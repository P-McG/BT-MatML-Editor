/*

-ParentSubClass: to use as a strongtypedef needs a < operator. Suspect because of the Class comparisions.
-Implement Subclass type in BulkDetails and ComponentDetails. Subclass contains the component's subclass(es) and may occur zero or more times within the ComponentDetails element. For additional information, see the	documentation for the SubClass type.
-Graph_GUI: needs implementation of SVG.
-Form: Description is currently name. Strongtypedef of Form::Description to Description needed.
-DataFormat: make sure it is implemented..
-AutoUnitConvert doesn't work
-void Data1_GUI::OnPropertyDataDataGnuUnitsCalcTextCtrl(wxCommandEvent& event) not working
- note you will get a parsing error if the *.xsd file is not with the *.xml file 
-The xml file must have xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance". examples given with MatML is xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance"  which doesn't work because it is not the same namespace as the matml31.xsd.
-Notes should have a word wrap option.
-Option in preference to show MatML_Info first or MatML_Data first. 
-Modifing uuid->id should swap throughout the MatML_Doc.
-?? Unit Name - treated as an attribute//Currency - treated as an attribute POPUP_LINK(UnitInsertCurrency,Currency) //POPUP_CONNECT(UnitInsertCurrency) 	//The following are treated as MatML Attributes due to casting (e.g. reinterpret_cast) from one cardinality to _optional cardinality not working properly (Authority portion is miscast). The consquence of this is that both Unit->Name and Unit->Currency don't have a authority.
-ComponentDetails' ComponentDetails is not yet implemented. Delete not implement.
-POPUP_PASTE2(Glossary,PasteTerm,Term)
- //void OnPasteName(wxCommandEvent& event);
- //void OnPasteCurrencyCode(wxCommandEvent& event);
-every sequence should have a bumpup bumpdown.
	   void OnElementBeginDrag(wxTreeEvent& event); //Not currently implemented. Still need todo
    void OnElementEndDrag(wxTreeEvent& event); //Not currently implemented. Still need todo
-Change the function name of Setup to something more discriptive like MatMLTree_Setup
-Allow the user to choose the prefix of the UUID in the preferences. 
-Create a validator for the condition that Id cannot be a pure UUID. Must have a Alpha begining not a numeric. This will throw a parse error. xs:IDs cannot have : characters anywhere in the name and cannot have a digit as the first character of the name.
-ParentMaterial selector may select nothing and create an invalid idref. Create a validator for this.
-need to validate Data1 input against the Data1::format()-int, float, string are done. But what exactly is mixed? 
-Validate Note - Multiple entries in the Data, Qualifier, Uncertainty Value, and\nParameterValue elements must be delimited (e.g. comma delimited) and\nsynchronized across elements, i.e., the number of entries\nin each of these four elements must be equal.
-Required MatML elements do we allow insert, delete, paste? e.g. BulkDetails->Name(). 
-Font sizes adjustable
-About dialog automatically adds version number.
-Add compile test to CMakeList.txt. Refer to https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/tutorial/Installing%20and%20Testing.html, https://wiki.wxwidgets.org/Command-Line_Arguments
